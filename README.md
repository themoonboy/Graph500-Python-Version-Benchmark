# Graph500-Python-Version-Benchmark
This is a Python implementation on [Graph500 benchmark](https://graph500.org), where there are only C version open-source codes and Octave version provided, you could easily find the official reference code [here](https://graph500.org/?page_id=47) or from their [github](https://github.com/graph500/graph500).

In convenient for private usage, I just mimic the Octave version of original Graph500 benchmark and rewrite into this Python version. I try to tightly follow the data structure and work flow used in Octave reference code, and find closest way to transfer them into Python language, all these corresponding codes located in folder [graph500_reference_code](https://github.com/themoonboy/Graph500-Python-Version-Benchmark/tree/master/graph500_reference_code).
